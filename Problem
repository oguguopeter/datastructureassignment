/*Description:

Problem 1
 
Given two sets of elements, find the sum of all distinct elements from the set. In other words, find the sum of all elements which are present in either of the given set.
Example:
Set 1 : [3, 1, 7, 9], Set 2: [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
Output: 13 (distinct elements 4, 7, 2 )
Give a solutions to this problem, using arrays

*/


1. Initialize an empty set `distinct_set`
2. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0
3. Initialize two sets `set1` and `set2` with elements
4. For each element `x` in `set1`, do steps 5-6
5.    If `x` is not in `distinct_set`, add it to `distinct_set` and add `x` to `sum`
6. For each element `y` in `set2`, do steps 7-8
7.    If `y` is not in `distinct_set`, add it to `distinct_set` and add `y` to `sum`
8. Print `sum`


Initialize sum = 0.
Create an empty array "distinct".
For each element "x" in set one:
    If "x" is not in set two or "distinct":
        Add "x" to the "distinct" array.
        Add "x" to the "sum" variable.
For each element "y" in set two:
    If "y" is not in set one or "distinct":
        Add "y" to the "distinct" array.
        Add "y" to the "sum" variable.
Return the "sum".

/*
Problem 2 
You are asked to write an algorithm that fulfill the following: 

Name: Dot product
Description:
Write a procedure, called dot_product which calculates in the variable ps, the dot(scalar) product of v1 and v2 (v1 and v2 are vectors of IR)
Write an algorithm which determines, for n pairs of given vectors, whether two vectors of given IR are orthogonal, by calling the procedure defined in the previous question. The dot product of two orthogonal vectors is zero.
Modify the previous algorithm if you use a dot_product function instead of a procedure.
*/

1. Define a function `dot_product` that takes in two vectors `v1` and `v2`
2. Initialize a variable `ps` to 0
3. For each index `i` in the range of the length of `v1`, do step 4
4.    Add the product of `v1[i]` and `v2[i]` to `ps`
5. Return `ps`
6. Define a list of `n` pairs of vectors `vector_pairs`
7. For each pair `v_pair` in `vector_pairs`, do step 8
8.    Calculate the dot product of `v_pair[0]` and `v_pair[1]` using the `dot_product` function, and store the result in `dp`
9.    If `dp` is 0, print "The vectors are orthogonal"
10.   Otherwise, print "The vectors are not orthogonal"
